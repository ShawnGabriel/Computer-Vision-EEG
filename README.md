# EEG-Computer-Vision Pipeline Reimplementation

This repository reimplements the pipeline described in [this article](https://medium.com/labs-notebook/computer-vision-eeg-pipeline-part-0-b4a5ee3ed04d). The goal is to process EEG data collected during visual tasks and combine it with computer vision techniques to analyze cognitive responses to visual stimuli.

## Features
- **EEG Preprocessing**: Bandpass filtering and data segmentation to clean raw EEG signals.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extraction of EEG features (e.g., Power Spectral Density) and visual features from pre-trained computer vision models.
- **Machine Learning**: Building and evaluating predictive models that combine EEG and visual data.
- **Reproducibility**: Modular implementation for end-to-end reusability and extensibility.
